1. Within your terminal, ensure you are in a place where you can create files.
2. Clone the directory where the README file is by typing `git clone <<url of repository>>`. Open the README file that is in the new directory that's been created, and verify that the content is the same as the one in the url above.
3. In your local git directory, create a directory labeled <<your first name>>. Commit your changes, and push them to the remote repository by typing `git push`.
4. After about 5 min, return to your local directory and type `git pull`. What happens?
5. (Extra) Add a file to your own directory, and get anothe delegate to try and 'pull' down your new file. What did you have to do, and what did they need to do?
